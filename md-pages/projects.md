#LEFT

I have mostly worked on backend side of things. 
I have experience in building and testing software with:
- Java (SpringBoot)
- Apache Spark (Scala)
- Microsoft Azure
- Python

Apart from this I experiment with a wide variety of in my projects.


- Distributed Systems and Networking with C/C++.
- Intel's DPDK framework.
- Computer System Security.
- Django/Flask.


Currently, I am working on project to come up with a **RPC framework with DPDK**.
DPDK is a userspace networking (kernel bypass) framework which provides fast networking.
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) are used by almost all distributed systems.

An RPC framework using DPDK will be fast and easy to use.
